🔎 Background & Overview

Organization: Quantium
Industry: Retail Analytics
Platform: Forage Virtual Internship
Timeframe: 2025

Quantium is a global leader in data-driven decision-making.
This internship simulated a real-world retail analytics challenge, where I took on the role of a data analyst identifying customer behavior patterns and evaluating marketing trial performance.

Business Objective

To use data analytics to:

Identify key customer segments for chip product promotions.

Measure the impact of marketing trials across retail stores.

Deliver actionable insights that improve commercial outcomes and campaign effectiveness.

🗂️ Data Structure Overview

Datasets Used:

QVI_transaction_data — product names, quantities, sales values, and dates.

QVI_purchasing_behaviour — customer demographic and value segmentation data.

These datasets were merged using lylty_card_nbr to connect purchase behavior with customer profiles.

Key Columns:

prod_name – Product name containing packet size (grams).

tot_sales – Total dollar value of the transaction.

premium_customer – Customer segment category.

lifestage – Life stage classification (e.g., young singles, older families).

(ERD or schema visualization can be added later for clarity.)

📊 Executive Summary

The Quantium Virtual Internship provided hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and marketing impact assessment.

Key Findings:

Mainstream customers contribute ~60% of total chip sales and are the most reliable segment for marketing focus.

150g–175g packets are universally preferred, representing core SKUs for revenue growth.

Premium customers spend more per transaction but purchase less often — ideal for loyalty programs.

No strong seasonality detected — demand is consistent throughout the year, allowing for stable inventory planning.

🔍 Insights Deep Dive
💡 1. Customer Segmentation & Revenue Optimization

Cleaned and standardized data using SQL and Python to extract product sizes and remove outliers.

Linked transactions with customer demographics to segment by life stage and premium status.

Identified Mainstream Customers (150g–175g buyers) as the most consistent, high-volume group driving ~60% of chip revenue.

💡 2. Sales Behavior Insights

Mainstream customers → Frequent, steady buyers.

Premium customers → High-spend but low-frequency purchases.

Budget customers → Price-sensitive and focused on smaller packs (120g–150g).

💡 3. Visualization & Trend Analysis

Created heatmaps and scatterplots to visualize relationships between packet size, revenue, and customer segment.

Found strong demand concentration in mid-sized packs (150–175g) and stable monthly performance with no seasonality.

💡 4. Store Performance Evaluation (Marketing Trial)

Conducted A/B testing to measure marketing uplift using t-tests and confidence intervals.

Selected control stores through pre-trial similarity scoring (based on KPIs).

Validated that uplift in trial stores was statistically significant, demonstrating marketing campaign impact measurement.

✅ Recommendations

Target Segment: Focus promotions on Mainstream Customers purchasing 150g–175g packets to maximize ROI.

Product Strategy: Maintain wide availability and competitive pricing for mid-sized SKUs; consider bundle offers (“Buy 2 × 175g, Get 1 Free”).

Inventory Optimization: Keep steady stock of core packet sizes, avoiding overproduction of low-demand large packs.

Premium Segment Growth: Use loyalty rewards and personalized offers to increase repeat purchases from premium customers.

Continuous Monitoring: Implement dashboards to track segment-level sales trends and campaign effectiveness.

💻 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy): For data wrangling, EDA, visualization, and statistical testing.

SQL: For dataset preparation, joins, and aggregations.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis, documentation, and visual storytelling.

PowerPoint: For summarizing technical results into stakeholder-ready presentations.

🧠 Key Insights Summary

Mainstream customers drive ~60% of total sales — the largest and most consistent buyer group.

150g–175g packet sizes dominate sales and should be the focus of promotional campaigns.

Premium customers prefer larger packs but purchase infrequently — ideal for loyalty incentives.

Sales show no seasonality, indicating stable demand and predictable supply needs.

🎯 Lessons Learned

Translating business objectives into measurable KPIs is key to meaningful analytics.

Real-world datasets are messy — cleaning and validation are as important as modeling.

Storytelling matters: insights must be communicated clearly for stakeholder action.

The experience improved my confidence in A/B testing, segmentation, and data-driven decision-making.
