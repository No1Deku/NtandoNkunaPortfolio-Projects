Retail Sales Analysis — Business Insights Report

This project transforms raw retail transaction data into clear business insights about customer behavior, revenue drivers, product performance, and loyalty patterns.
Every insight is accompanied by visual evidence so that you can follow the entire analytical process directly from this README.

1. Project Overview

Retailers need to understand:

Who their most valuable customers are

How different demographics behave

Which products and price points drive the most revenue

Where loyalty is gained or lost

What seasonal or time-based patterns exist

This project answers those questions through a full analytical workflow:

✅ Data Preparation
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis
✅ Demographic & Behavioral Insights
✅ RFM Loyalty Analysis
✅ Business Recommendations

All visuals are pulled from the /assets folder.

2. Data Preparation

Before any analysis, the data was cleaned, validated, and structured.

✅ Data Overview

✅ Data Quality Summary

Key preparation steps:

Standardized column names

Converted date column to datetime

Verified age, quantity, and price ranges

Confirmed 0 missing values and 0 duplicates

Created age segments & RFM metrics

This foundation ensured reliable downstream analysis.

3. Exploratory Analysis
3.1 Revenue Over Time
✅ Daily Revenue Trend

✅ Daily Revenue (Enhanced View)

✅ Monthly Revenue with Trendline

(This file name mixes age/gender but is actually a time grouping in your folder)


Insights:

Highest revenue peaks occur in February and May

September is consistently the lowest performing month

Rolling averages show a stable upward trend

3.2 Price & Product Insights
✅ Price per Unit Distribution

✅ Price Frequency by Product Category

Insights:

The store uses five key price points

Price alone does not explain purchasing behavior

Category-level price ladders suggest intentional “good, better, best” strategies

3.3 Customer Demographics
✅ Age Distribution

Age bins used for analysis:

18–25: Emerging Shoppers

26–35: Young Professionals

36–45: Prime Spenders

46–55: Established Buyers

56–65: Loyal Customers

66+: Senior Shoppers

4. Revenue & Behavioral Analysis
4.1 Revenue by Gender

Insight:
Female customers generate slightly more revenue and purchase more often.

4.2 Revenue by Age Group & Gender
✅ Combined Breakdown

✅ Revenue Across Segments & Categories

Insights:

Ages 26–45 are the core spending groups

Females consistently drive more revenue across all ages

Younger and older groups spend less and purchase less frequently

5. Customer Loyalty Analysis (RFM)

RFM identifies:

Recency: How recently customers bought

Frequency: How often they buy

Monetary: How much they spend

5.1 Customer Segment Distribution

5.2 RFM Score by Age & Gender

Insights:

Strongest loyalty appears in Females aged 26–45

Older customers spend well but show declining recency → churn risk

Younger customers have lower frequency but high growth potential

6. Key Business Insights
✅ Most Valuable Customer Group

Female shoppers aged 26–45
High loyalty, high frequency, and high monetary value.

✅ Customer Segments at Risk

Older customers show reduced recency
→ target with retention and win-back campaigns.

✅ Seasonal Strategy

Strong spikes in February and May

Weak performance in September
→ opportunities for campaign testing

✅ Product Strategy

Categories contribute evenly

Price points cluster neatly → pricing opportunities

7. Business Recommendations
✅ Strengthen Loyalty & Retention

Reward Champions

Re-engage older segments

Build onboarding nudges for younger segments

✅ Optimize Merchandising

Prepare inventory around high-performing price points

Maintain balanced category representation

✅ Calendar-Based Promotions

Maximize the two natural peak months
